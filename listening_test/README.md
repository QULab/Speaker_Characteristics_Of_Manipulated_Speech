# Listening test 

### Goal

To assess the effects of manipulated speech (pitch, pitch range and formant shifts) on speaker attributions (warmth-attractiveness).



### Speech stimuli

Speakers (from the [NSC corpus](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=nsc-corpus)):

* Females, positive WAAT: 
  * w102_aden
  * w257_nasinu
* Females, negative WAAT: 
  * w161_vaitele
  * w266_turkmenabat
* Males, positive WAAT:
  * m041_bucharest
  * m097_basseterre
* Males, negative WAAT:
  * m090_riyadh
  * m294_portauprince



Manipulation conditions:

* Original speech: no manipulation.
* Pitch: shifting mean pitch frequency
  * if speakers are originally positively perceived: by 40Hz up 
  * if speakers are originally negatively perceived: by 40Hz down 
* Pitch range: extending or narrowing pitch range
  * if speakers are originally positively perceived: pitch range 40% down
  * if speakers are originally negatively perceived: pitch range 40% up
* Pitch and pitch range (combined): shifting mean pitch frequency and extending or narrowing pitch range
  * if speakers are originally positively perceived: pitch 40Hz up and pitch range 40% down
  * if speakers are originally negatively perceived: pitch 40Hz down and pitch range 40% up
* Pitch and formant shift (combined): shifting mean pitch frequency and formant frequencies
  * if speakers are originally positively perceived: pitch 40Hz up and formant frequencies shift by 10% up
  * if speakers are originally negatively perceived: pitch 40Hz down and formant frequencies shift by 10% down

Total: 8 speakers x 5 conditions = 40 speech stimuli.
